# Flight Price Prediction

My Machine Learning project is a flight price prediction application. Users can input various travel details such as arrival and departure dates, times, departure and destination locations, and any desired stops. The application analyzes these criteria to predict the most accurate and competitive flight prices, helping users make informed decisions and find the best deals for their trips.
